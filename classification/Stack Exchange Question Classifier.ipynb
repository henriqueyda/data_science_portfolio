In this matrix each row correspond to a document and each column is every word in the dataset and the values correspond to the frequency of that word in the document. After that, we calculate the Tf-Idf, which is a statistic that measures how important a word is to both the document and the entire dataset, then we apply Naive-Bayes. All this process is summarized in sklearn Pipeline object."
